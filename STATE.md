# PROJECT STATE: tutoring-platform

- **Active Project:** tutoring-platform (Next.js 14 App Router, Prisma ORM, Neon PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Motion.dev)
- **Active Branch:** `main`
- **Last Completed Work:** Rebuilt Tutor Dashboard (`/tutor/dashboard` with `/tutor` redirect) following exact client specifications: closest session due timer countdown banner, picture-free course selection cards with prominent student headcounts, active session recording bar, and deterministic date formatting. Added unit test suite (`tests/unit/tutor-dashboard.test.ts`), verified 100% test pass (29/29), zero lint/token violations, and passed multi-viewport visual audits (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1440px) with zero horizontal spill.
- **Immediate Next Move:** Implement session student attendance roster management & student recording iteration per tutor selection.
- **Blockers / Open Decisions:** None.

## BUG TRIAGE LOG
- **Bug:** `Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "16 Sept, 02:03" Client: "Sep 16, 02:03 AM"` and `Image with src "/logo.png" has "fill" but is missing "sizes" prop`.
- **Root Cause:** Direct calls to `toLocaleString([], ...)` without a pinned locale and timezone caused format divergence between server environment (en-GB/Cairo) and client browser (en-US).
- **Files Touched:**
  - `src/shared/utils/date-format.ts` (New shared deterministic formatter)
  - `tests/unit/date-format.test.ts` (New regression test suite)
  - `src/features/sessions/components/gadwal-table.tsx` (Replaced `toLocaleString` with `formatDateTime`)
  - `src/features/wallets/components/transaction-ledger.tsx` (Replaced `toLocaleString` with `formatDateTime`)
  - `src/app/(portal)/student/dashboard/_components/UpcomingLecturesCard.tsx` (Deduplicated to shared `formatSessionSchedule`)
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (Added `sizes="36px"` to `<Image />`)
- **Verification:** Vitest 25/25 passing, ESLint and token lint passing with zero errors, `/tutor/agenda` rendered with zero hydration warnings.
